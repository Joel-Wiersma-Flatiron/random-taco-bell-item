# random-mcdonalds-menu-item
Have you ever wanted something from McDonald's, but didn't know what. This is perfect for you then, as it will scrape the McDonald's website for all their menu items then randomly select one for you. Also, the repository says Taco Bell, but their website didn't want to work with scraping and I wanted to keep all the commits visible.

# Installation
To install this, while in Github press the code button where a dropdown will appear. click SSH then the clipboard button next to the text. Open up Ubuntu and type "git clone " without the quotes then paste the file location and hit enter. You will then have to cd into the file and use "code ." or by running the executible to open up the process in VS Code. You can then run the program by typing "ruby bin/random-mcdonalds-menu-item" into your VS Code terminal.
